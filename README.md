Network Security: Network security refers to the protection of computer networks from unauthorized access, theft, damage, and other malicious activities. It involves a combination of hardware, software, and policies designed to secure network communication and data transmission within an organization or between organizations.

Types of Network Security:
There are several types of network security measures that organizations can implement to protect their networks and sensitive data from unauthorized access, attacks, and breaches. 

Some of the most common types of network security are:

•	Firewall

•	Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

•	Virtual Private Network (VPN)

•	Antivirus/Anti-malware

•	Access Control

•	Data Encryption

•	Network Segmentation

•	Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

The primary objective of network security is to prevent unauthorized access to network resources and ensure that only authorized users have access to them. Network security includes various technologies and practices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPN), access control, encryption, and secure protocols, to protect against network-based attacks, malware, data breaches, and other security threats.
